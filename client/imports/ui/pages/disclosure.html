      <h3>iii. Expiration of benefits.</h3>
      <p>
        The benefits of FastX's normal operation do not expire.<br/>
        The right of the customer to any unclaimed funds (for example, in the case of a failed transaction) will expire after a period of 24 months from the date of the transaction
        and is subject to the customer having made reasonable attempts to contact FastX with the details of the transaction within the 24 months.
        The payment date of the transaction is the date that the customer submitted an amount in AUD for conversion into the relevant crypto currency. This date can be found on
        on the bill summary on the FastX main page and in the confirmation email you may have emailed yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Payments</h2>
      <h3>i. Mistakes and unauthorised transactions.</h3>
      <p>
        All payments are final. If a transfer is made in error you will need to contact the payee (whose account details you provided for the transfer) directly in order to recover the funds.
        FastX may attempt to help contact the payee at its discretion but accepts no responsability or liability for any mistaken or unauthorised transactions.
      </p>

      <h3>ii. Incorrect payment amounts.</h3>
      <p>
        If you transfer <b>more</b> cryptocurrency than the amount we specify on the transaction page, you will forfeit the difference between the amount you transferred and the amount which we requested.<br>
        If you transfer <b>less</b> cryptocurrency than the amount we specify on the transaction page, your payment to the payee will not complete. You will then be instructed to contact support at support@fastx.io
        and submit an additional payment at the current cryptocurrency exchange rate to cover the shortfall in the original transaction.
      </p>
